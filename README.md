This project was the second project in the JavaScript module of The Odin Project. The main goal of this project was to practice using factory functions and the module design pattern to keep the global namespace as clear as possible.

Skills demonstrated during the course of this project include:

- Using factory functions to create multiple object instances
- Using the module design pattern to segment code into "public" and "private" variables and methods
- Breaking down and dividing complicated logic into smaller chunks for reusability and clarity
